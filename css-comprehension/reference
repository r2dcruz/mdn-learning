As you’ll see, in this example the global font-size has been set to 10px in the second rule:

.html {
font-family: ‘Helvetica neue’, Arial, ‘sans serif’;
font-size: 10px;
background-color: #ccc;
}

This means that 1em is 10px, for descendants of <html>, unless a different font-size has been set anywhere in the hierarchy, which in this case it isn’t until we get to the <h2> inside the <header> and the <p> inside the <footer> (see below).

The next significant rule we have is this:

.card header, .card footer {
height: 3em;
padding: 1em;
}

Here we are setting the height of the <header> and <footer> to 3em, which as hinted above, will compute to 30px in real terms (3 x 10 = 30)

So the height of these blocks is 30px — this is what we need to center our text in.

The slightly (but not very) tricky bit comes in these rules:

.card header h2 {
font-size: 2em;
line-height: 1.5;
}
 
.card footer p {
font-size: 1.5em;
line-height: 2;
}

Here we have set the font-size of the <h2> to 2em, which computes to 20px, and the font-size of the <p> to 1.5em, which computes to 15px.

We need to set the line-height to 30px so the text will sit in the center of the containing block’s height, in each case.

For the <h2>, we set line-height as 1.5 — 2 x 1.5 = 30.

For the <p>, we set line-height as 2 — 1.5 x 2 = 30.

We are using unitless line-height values, which calculate the line-height relative to the font-size set on the element, as it is often useful to set everything relative to the font-size. To simplify it further, you could just use an absolute line-height value of 30px for both.

Hope this helps, and best regards.
